# TicTacToe
Simple TicTacToe game with command line interface created to prove my knowledge of Java fundamentals and Oboject-Oriented concepts.
## About TicTacToe
This summer I participated in Complete Java Masterclass course on Udemy. This game was created as a revision of what I learned during the online course and University Lectures (where Java fundamentals where covered).
TicTacToe game implementation is kinda big to show my understanding of OOP concepts (inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction and encapsulation) and Java fundamentals that must be known to work as Android Developer.
## Core Java in my TicTacToe implementation
1. Natural use of overloading and overriding
2. Composition (over Inheritance ;) )
3. Basic Java Collection Framework usage (Data structures as ArrayLists and interfaces as Iterable, Comparable etc.)
4. String manipulation
5. Implementation of popular data stucture (Stack) with Generics
6. Usage of abstract classes to build a family of objects. 
7. Usage of interfaces to make certain objects have needed funcionality
8. Basic JUnit 4 usage to provide units (methods) tests for the most of written code.
9. Understanding of handling Exceptions (IO, Arrays etc.)
## Future of the project
Right now the game is "playable" in PLAYER vs PLAYER mode. I was planning to implement PLAYER vs COMPUTER (Strict algorithm and Machine learning to analyze other players moves) mode, but because of lack of time I will polish up the current code, write some test and will not commit changes often in future.
